\section{Changes to Goals} 

\subsection{M\"obius Simulation}


\subsection{Consistent Boot/Recovery Procedure}
The plan remains the same for this project, we have just scoped out how exactly
we plan to deliver on this. As a simplified description, IlliniSat uses the
u-boot bootloader to load the Linux kernel.  We decided that we will modify
u-boot to calculate the CRC of multiple kernel images and boot an image that
verifies.  In order to develop this without purchasing a board or slowing down
the rest of IlliniSat's software development, we decided use QEMU with ARM. The
MityARM-335x used in IlliniSat is not available in QEMU and adding it would be
far beyond the scope of the class (though useful for future work in IlliniSat).
Therefore, we chose to use a standard ARM board that is often used with QEMU,
the Versatile PowerBoard.  Though this uses an older processor (ARM9 vs. Cortex
A-8), we believe that the development procedure and codepaths should be similar
enough to be useful for IlliniSat.

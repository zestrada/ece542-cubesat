%Not sure if we want separate sections here as well, or if we want to itemize,
%etc...
Recovery/boot: the plan is to finish developing the script and then test it with
corrupted kernels.  The final deliverable will be documentation and scripts for
generating the u-boot script image and flash image with multiple copies of the
kernel.  If possible, we would like to provide this functionality in a modular,
automated way (possibly a Makefile).

Flash Patrol: The plan will be to fix the CRC code that is needed to write
CRCs for created/modified files. After that is finished we will implement the 
complementary daemon that checks the validity of these CRCs. In addition, 
we will change the CRC generation daemon to use signals instead of polling.

Recovery/boot: the plan is to finish developing the script and then test it with
corrupted kernels.  The final deliverable will be documentation and scripts for
generating the u-boot script image and flash image with multiple copies of the
kernel.  If possible, we would like to provide this functionality in a modular,
automated way (possibly a Makefile).

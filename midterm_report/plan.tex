\section{Plan}

%Not sure if we want separate sections here as well, or if we want to itemize,
%etc...
M\"obius model: the completed model will be used during development to determine which new approaches provide the best performance.  The final deliverable will be the description of the model along with the results of the analysis of our improved boot/recovery process.

Recovery/boot: the plan is to finish developing the script and then test it with
corrupted kernels.  The final deliverable will be documentation and scripts for
generating the u-boot script image and flash image with multiple copies of the
kernel.  If possible, we would like to provide this functionality in a modular,
automated way (possibly a Makefile).

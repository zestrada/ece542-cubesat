To do the fault injection, we created a small dummy filesystem:
---
dd if=/dev/zero of=./test_fs bs=1M count=10
mkfs.ext2 -F ./test_fs 
sudo mkdir /mnt/inotify
sudo mount ./test_fs /mnt/inotify/
---

and created a large random file:
---
dd if=/dev/urandom of=/mnt/inotify/file bs=1M count=9
---

then checked its contents:
---
md5sum /mnt/inotify/file 
8ce0d81e78ee328df19ea54df8d462aa  /mnt/inotify/file
---

and modified it with a file containing all A
---
9.0M  fonz.txt
---
 
line 300000 seems good for bit flipping

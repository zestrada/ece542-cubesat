Today I continued with getting the whole while loop working for attempting to
boot multiple images.

as usual, we the documentation for how to do these while loops and such is
almost completely lacking

things I'm trying (since u-boot doesn't support command history):
---
while test $NUM_IMAGES > 0; do; setexpr kernadd ${kernadd} + ${KERNEL_SIZE}; setexpr NUM_IMAGES NUM_IMAGES - 1 ;  done
---

my script command
---
source 0x2B82C
---

and I needed to add CONFIG_CMD_ECHO

now I tested with my faulty image as the first
---
VersatilePB # imi 0x34000000

## Checking Image at 34000000 ...
   Legacy image found
   Image Name:   Linux-3.2.57
   Image Type:   ARM Linux Kernel Image (uncompressed)
   Data Size:    1737408 Bytes = 1.7 MiB
   Load Address: 00008000
   Entry Point:  00008000
   Verifying Checksum ...    Bad Data CRC
---

but... my editing of the uImage had changed the size of the image. Our fault
model won't cover that since we assume the images were written to flash cleanly

but the script worked wonderfully

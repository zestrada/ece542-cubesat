Today I continued with getting the whole while loop working for attempting to
boot multiple images.

as usual, we the documentation for how to do these while loops and such is
almost completely lacking

things I'm trying (since u-boot doesn't support command history):
---
while test $NUM_IMAGES > 0; do; setexpr kernadd ${kernadd} + ${KERNEL_SIZE}; setexpr NUM_IMAGES NUM_IMAGES - 1 ;  done
---

my script command
---
source 0x2B82C
---

and I needed to add CONFIG_CMD_ECHO

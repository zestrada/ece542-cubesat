I now tried adding 
---
#define CONFIG_CMD_RUN 
--- 

to versatile.h

and rebuilt test-boot.img

keeping in mind that the added code increased the size of the uboot image,
here's where we are now:
---
0x2B090
---

fair enough:
---
VersatilePB # run 0x2B090
## Error: "0x2B090" not defined
VersatilePB # run 2b090
## Error: "2b090" not defined
---

probably should try the source command

and now we're at 0x2B35C

hmmm...
---
VersatilePB # source 0x2B35C
## Executing script at 0002b35c
VersatilePB # printenv
baudrate=38400
bootargs=console=ttyAMA0
bootcmd=bootm 0x34000000
bootdelay=2
bootfile=/tftpboot/uImage
ethact=SMC91111-0
ethaddr=52:54:00:12:34:56
stderr=serial
stdin=serial
stdout=serial
verify=n
---

so it works, that's good

and then "run bootcmd" boots the Linux kernel

Next, I decided to work on automating the generation of the script image, etc...

Not sure if we want the u-boot script sitting in memory or in flash, but for now
I'm doing memory (I think MLO will handle copying it to memory from flash)

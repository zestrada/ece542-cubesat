Today I downloaded u-boot 2013.10 and kernel 3.2.57 to match their versions
better

I recompiled those and started trying to figure out the whole u-boot thing

booting the kernel didn't work the best though - since I didn't have a root
filesystem. 

I want to get the NFS thing working

maybe I need to build an initrd and just use that as a file system

my goal is to get an nfs based file system working (since that's what u-boot
expects by default) with the Linux kernel. 

Then I'll move on to working u-boot into the mix

this boots the kernel into console mode:
---
[zak@ungar linux-3.2.57]$ qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -m 512M -kernel
./arch/arm/boot/zImage -append console=ttyAMA0 -nographic
---

time to get the NFS root working... or maybe just initrd

I'm downloading this image:
http://wiki.qemu.org/download/arm-test-0.2.tar.gz

that ended with an "attempted to kill init"

probably need to craft a rootfs:

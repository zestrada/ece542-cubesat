\section{Introduction}
Passive security monitoring (not to be confused with passive Internet
monitoring) is the technique of polling the state of a system and the inspecting
the captured state for anomalies corresponding to a violation of security
policy. Passive monitoring is suitable for persistent failures and attacks
because it assumes the corrupted or compromised state remains in the system
sufficiently longer than the polling period.  However, this is not always the
case and many times an attacker can evade a monitor through a variety of
techniques, as laid out in the next Section.

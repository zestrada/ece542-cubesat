\section{Timeline and Work Distribution}

\subsection{Timeline}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Week 1 (4/8): Develop fault model, continued brainstorming
  \item Week 2 (4/15): Initial development of various SW modules
  \item Week 3 (4/22, midterm presentation): Commit to software module
  \item Week 4 (4/29): Software development and testing
  \item Week 5 (5/6): Final model and simulation results, done developing SW
  \item Week 6 (5/10): Finish writing, finishing touches and knowledge transfer
  with IlliniSat team
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Work Distribution}
There are multiple proposed approaches and it is unclear which will be the most
feasible and yield the best gain for IlliniSat.  Therefore, we intend to
individually start on each of the approaches and eventually converge on at least
one simulation and one software module to complete as a team.

\begin{itemize}
  \item{M\"obius simulation of memory corruption}: Matt
  \item{Develop a consistent boot/recovery procedure}: Zak
  \item{Develop a flash patrol read daemon}: Eric
  \item{Develop a method to increase reliability of ground station}: Backup in
  case one of the others quickly appears to be infeasible
\end{itemize}

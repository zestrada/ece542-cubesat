\section{Literature Review}

There is already an existing body of work that deals with CubeSats and investigations of their reliability.  \cite{odegaard2013error} discusses developing software systems to increase the reliability of a CubeSat.  Two of the systems discussed in \cite{odegaard2013error}, a watchdog timer and a recovery mode, are already used in IlliniSat.  \cite{odegaard2013error} also proposes solutions for protecting the satellite's program code, although its implementation is unable to handle the case of a corrupted kernel with no saved system checkpoints; our approach stores multiple copies of the kernel, so it is able to recover even if a single kernel image is completely corrupted.

There has also been significant work in using hardware-based reliability measures in CubeSat designs.  As the IlliniSat project has already fixed its hardware requirements and as we wish to produce advice and solutions that can be directly applied to IlliniSat, we do not consider these approaches in this work.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{IlliniSat}
A CubeSat is a small satellite ($\sim$~1kg) that can be delivered as a secondary
payload or as a ``shared ride'' with a number of other satellites, thus lowering
the cost to launch\cite{toorian2008cubesat}.  With an estimated cost of roughly
\$52,000\footnote{\url{http://www.satmagazine.com/story.php?number=602922274}}
to put an educational CubeSat in orbit, CubeSats are well within the budget of
many universities.  The University of Illinois has a
CubeSat\footnote{\url{http://cubesat.ae.illinois.edu/index.php}} program in
which a class and dedicated team have been developing a scalable picosatellite
($<$~1kg) bus, IlliniSat-2.  IlliniSat-2 is intended to be used for multiple
missions, the first of which (Lower Atmosphere/Ionosphere Coupling Experiment,
LAICE) is planned to launch around December 2014.  This mission will involve
three scientific payloads: one from Illinois and two from Virginia Tech.  In
collaboration with Bindu Jagannatha and Alex Ghosh of the IlliniSat-2 team, this
project aims to analyze and enhance the reliability of the computing systems
used in IlliniSat-2.

The IlliniSat-2 bus contains various systems, and this project focuses on the
Command and Data Handling (C\&DH) system.  The C\&DH system is responsible
for maintaining the mission schedule and coordinating the communication of the
satellite with the ground station.  The C\&DH system is based on a MitySOM-335x
Processor Card, built with a TI AM335x Application Processor System-on-Chip
(SoC).\footnote{\url{http://www.criticallink.com/wp-content/uploads/MitySOM-335x_Datasheet.pdf}}
An embedded Linux distribution, Arago, is run on top of the TI SoC and
IlliniSat's functionality is implemented in set of userspace deamons. The
standard \fix{atd} utility is used to schedule tasks.
%FIXME: include C&DH figure 

Currently, the system has a watchdog timer that will reboot the flight computer
if it does not receive a heartbeat every 60 seconds.  The watchdog is part of a
health monitoring system that also observes the state of the battery, satellite 
attitude, temperature, etc...  If the health monitor determines that the system
is in a faulty state, it will transition C\&DH into a recovery mode (e.g. if the
battery is low, switch off all nonessentials and point the satellite towards the
sun).
%FIXME: do we want the health monitor figure?
%FIXME: define SPoF

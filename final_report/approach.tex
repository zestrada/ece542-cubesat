\subsection{Building the Fault Model in M\"obius}\label{sec:buildingmodel}

We chose to motivate the development of the boot protection script by developing a SAN model in M\"obius.

We choose to measure reliability as the relevant dependability metric because the continuous operation of the satellite is critical to the IlliniSAT team; furthermore, the failure that we are modeling is catastrophic.  As the satellite cannot recover from any failure of this type, it does not make sense to measure the system's availability.

The parameters used in this model are shown in Table \ref{tab:parameters}.

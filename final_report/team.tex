\section{Work Distribution}\label{sec:team}
Throughout the course of this project, we maintained open communication and met
regularly.  Since we started off with three separate objectives, it became clear
that it would be best to split off into multiple directions.  The original plan
was to split into these multiple directions and converge on whichever solution
seemed most feasible, in anticipation of some subprojects failing.  However,
this did not happen so we accomplished all that we started to do.  The final
work distribution ended up being:\\

\noindent Matt
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Fault model development}
  \item{M\"obius simulation}
\end{itemize} 
\noindent Zak
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Boot protection modifications for U-boot}
  \item{Fault injection for U-boot and daemons}
\end{itemize}
\noindent Eric
\begin{itemize}
  \item{Flash patrol daemon}
  \item{CRC checker daemon}
\end{itemize}
